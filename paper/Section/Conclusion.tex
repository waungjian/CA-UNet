\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we effectively integrate CNN and Swin Transformer's window self-attention based on dynamic weight allocation mechanism, and designs CA block to enhance the sensitivity of the network to local features, as well as to extract and effectively fuse global feature information. Secondly, a downsampling module based on Res block and full-scale skip connection based on CBAM are designed to further enhance the model's ability to perceive complex details in medical images and understand abstract semantic information, thereby improving the clarity of edge segmentation. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on two public medical image segmentation datasets. The experimental results validate that compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, CA-UNet has leading advantages in average DSC and HD95.
